It's sole, simple idea is to highlight the names of British Members of Parliament on any webpage, and to show a tooltip with an (admittedly slightly confusing at the moment) voting record, with data drawn from the <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/\">They Work For You</a> <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/\">API</a>:</p>\n<p>The problem was that not only was my extension highlighting the names of MPs, it was also highlighting all code displays in Github.</p>\n<p>Thinking at first this had something to do with the <a href=\"https://github.com/bartaz/sandbox.js/blob/master/jquery.highlight.js\">third party highlight script</a> I was using, but on inspecting Github's markup for the code element I found that it was contained in a table with the class name of <code>highlight</code>, which happened to be the class name I was using to highlight MP's names. So it was just a case of my SASS seeing that table and applying the yellow background to it. All I had to do was change the class name I used in the highlight call:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token function\">$</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'body'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">highlight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>mps<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>name<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\r\n\t<span class=\"token literal-property property\">wordsOnly</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\r\n\t<span class=\"token literal-property property\">className</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'mpHighlight'</span>\r\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And all was right with the world again.
