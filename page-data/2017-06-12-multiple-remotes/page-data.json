So I've been happily building and committing, pushing to my remote on Bitbucket. Then I want to quickly test creating a public repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> and posting to it. So I create a new GitHub account, new SSH keys for it, and -- inevitably -- accidentally make GitHub my new remote <code>origin</code>. Now I'm still not ready to go live with this, I've deleted the GitHub repo but now need to set my local repo back up with the Bitbucket remote.</p>\n<p>Solution: First, remove the GitHub remote: <code>git remote rm origin</code>. Now, add the older Bitbucket repo: <code>git remote add origin [url]</code>. But now, when I try to push to the remote branch with <code>git push origin master</code>, I get this error: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>remote: Unauthorized\nfatal: Authentication failed for '<a href=\"https://xxxxx@bitbucket.org/xxxxx/proj.git/\">https://xxxxx@bitbucket.org/xxxxx/proj.git/</a>'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/17671315\">this SO answer</a> I removed the remote branch and re-added it using the SSH url. After this I was able to push to it.</p>","fields":{"title":"multiple remotes","date":"12 June, 2017","url":"http://unlikenesses.com/2017-06-12-multiple-remotes/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-06-12-multiple-remotes/","prev":{"fields":{"title":"understanding react","date":"04 April, 2017","slug":"/2017-04-04-understanding-react/"}},"next":{"fields":{"title":"vue transitions","date":"21 June, 2017","slug":"/2017-06-21-vue-transitions/"}}}}}
