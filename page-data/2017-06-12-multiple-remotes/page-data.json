So I've been happily building and committing, pushing to my remote on Bitbucket. Then I want to quickly test creating a public repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> and posting to it. So I create a new GitHub account, new SSH keys for it, and -- inevitably -- accidentally make GitHub my new remote <code>origin</code>. Now I'm still not ready to go live with this, I've deleted the GitHub repo but now need to set my local repo back up with the Bitbucket remote.</p>\n<p>Solution: First, remove the GitHub remote: <code>git remote rm origin</code>. Now, add the older Bitbucket repo: <code>git remote add origin [url]</code>. But now, when I try to push to the remote branch with <code>git push origin master</code>, I get this error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>remote: Unauthorized\r\nfatal: Authentication failed for '<a href=\"https://xxxxx@bitbucket.org/xxxxx/proj.git/\">https://xxxxx@bitbucket.org/xxxxx/proj.git/</a>'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/17671315\">this SO answer</a> I removed the remote branch and re-added it using the SSH url. After this I was able to push to it.</p>","fields":{"title":"multiple remotes","date":"12 June 2017","url":"https://unlikenesses.com/2017-06-12-multiple-remotes/","slug":"/2017-06-12-multiple-remotes/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2332c890-8df1-5836-a501-40dec8ef58d2","fields__slug":"/2017-06-12-multiple-remotes/","__params":{"fields__slug":"2017-06-12-multiple-remotes"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2328167765"],"slicesMap":{}}
