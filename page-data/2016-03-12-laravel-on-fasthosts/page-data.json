To be precise, I'm deploying to a Fasthosts server. While this obviously isn't ideal, sometimes there's no escaping it, and there's no reason you can't deploy Laravel to Fasthosts. Here are the steps I went through (I'm using Laravel 5.2).</p>\n<p>My FTP space looked like this at the start:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">├── /\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── htdocs\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── logfiles\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── webapp</code></pre></div>\n<p>Normally you would upload your web site to <code>htdocs</code>, but with Laravel things are slightly different. You don't want the application source code to be publicly accessible. So I created a new folder to contain this code, on the same level as <code>htdocs</code>, and called it <code>app_base</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">├── /\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── app_base\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── htdocs\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── logfiles\r\n<span class=\"token operator\">|</span>   ├── webapp</code></pre></div>\n<p>Before uploading it was necessary to make a small change to the <code>public/index.php</code> file. I changed the first two lines to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"php\"><pre class=\"language-php\"><code class=\"language-php\"><span class=\"token keyword\">require</span> <span class=\"token constant\">__DIR__</span><span class=\"token operator\">.</span><span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'/../app_base/bootstrap/autoload.php'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n<span class=\"token variable\">$app</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">require_once</span> <span class=\"token constant\">__DIR__</span><span class=\"token operator\">.</span><span class=\"token string single-quoted-string\">'/../app_base/bootstrap/app.php'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I uploaded the contents of my website's <code>public</code> folder to <code>htdocs</code>, and the rest of the app to <code>app_base</code>. I visit my website in the browser, and get a <code>500</code> error. Fasthosts stores their error logs in the <code>logfiles</code> folder, so I go there and open up <code>error.log</code>, and see \"Option MultiViews not allowed here\".</p>\n<p>This relates to a section in <code>public/.htaccess</code>: <code>Options -MultiViews</code>. By removing that I have a fully working Laravel app on Fasthosts.</p>","fields":{"title":"laravel on fasthosts","date":"12 March 2016","url":"https://unlikenesses.com/2016-03-12-laravel-on-fasthosts/","slug":"/2016-03-12-laravel-on-fasthosts/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f46cffa4-9f15-577c-9554-7b433067744a","fields__slug":"/2016-03-12-laravel-on-fasthosts/","__params":{"fields__slug":"2016-03-12-laravel-on-fasthosts"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2328167765"],"slicesMap":{}}
