So here's a brief post to tell you what I did; hopefully it'll be useful for anyone else in the same situation.</p>\n<p>In <code>config.php</code>, remove the options which are no longer in the new default <code>config.php</code>, and add the ones specified in the <a href=\"https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/upgrade_300.html\">upgrade guide</a>. </p>\n<p>Set <code>sess_driver</code> to <code>files</code>.</p>\n<p>In the <code>Auth</code> controller, remove <code>$this->load->library('security');</code> this is because the security library is loaded automatically.</p>\n<p>In the same controller, add <code>$this->load->helper('security');</code> -- this allows the XSS clean method which is used in Tank Auth's default controller. You might as well also remove <code>xss_clean</code> from the validation rules in the <code>Auth</code> controller - these are now obsolete. See this <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28568871/codeigniter-3-unable-to-access-an-error-message\">this</a> Stack Overflow question. </p>\n<p>All this is of course assuming that the rest of the instructions in the <a href=\"https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/upgrade_300.html\">upgrade guide</a> have been followed.</p>","fields":{"title":"tanking","date":"22 October, 2015","url":"http://unlikenesses.com/2015-10-22-tanking/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2015-10-22-tanking/","prev":{"fields":{"title":"soft cascading","date":"09 October, 2015","slug":"/2015-10-09-soft-cascading/"}},"next":{"fields":{"title":"backbone todo tutorial part one","date":"16 December, 2015","slug":"/2015-12-16-backbone-todo-tutorial-part-one/"}}}}}
