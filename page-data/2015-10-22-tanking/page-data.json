So here's a brief post to tell you what I did; hopefully it'll be useful for anyone else in the same situation.</p>\n<p>In <code>config.php</code>, remove the options which are no longer in the new default <code>config.php</code>, and add the ones specified in the <a href=\"https://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/upgrade_300.html\">upgrade guide</a>.</p>\n<p>Set <code>sess_driver</code> to <code>files</code>.</p>\n<p>In the <code>Auth</code> controller, remove <code>$this->load->library('security');</code> this is because the security library is loaded automatically.</p>\n<p>In the same controller, add <code>$this->load->helper('security');</code> -- this allows the XSS clean method which is used in Tank Auth's default controller. You might as well also remove <code>xss_clean</code> from the validation rules in the <code>Auth</code> controller - these are now obsolete.
