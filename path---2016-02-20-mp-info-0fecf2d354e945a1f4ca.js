It\'s sole, simple idea is to highlight the names of British Members of Parliament on any webpage, and to show a tooltip with an (admittedly slightly confusing at the moment) voting record, with data drawn from the <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">They Work For You</a> <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/api/">API</a>:</p>\n<p>![temp2.gif]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/temp2.gif)</p>\n<p>The problem was that not only was my extension highlighting the names of MPs, it was also highlighting all code displays in Github.</p>\n<p>![temp1.PNG]({{ site.baseurl }}public/images/temp1.PNG)</p>\n<p>Thinking at first this had something to do with the <a href="https://github.com/bartaz/sandbox.js/blob/master/jquery.highlight.js">third party highlight script</a> I was using, but on inspecting Github\'s markup for the code element I found that it was contained in a table with the class name of <code>highlight</code>, which happened to be the class name I was using to highlight MP\'s names. So it was just a case of my SASS seeing that table and applying the yellow background to it. All I had to do was change the class name I used in the highlight call:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-js"><code><span class="token function">$</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">\'body\'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">highlight</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>mps<span class="token punctuation">[</span>i<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> \n\twordsOnly<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> \n\tclassName<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">\'mpHighlight\'</span> \n<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>And all was right with the world again.
